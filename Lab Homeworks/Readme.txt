Uploaded the code for first homework in the file "RGB_led.ino"(initially uploaded in the main folder rather than the homework one).The code allows you to use the values recieved from three potentiometers in order to regulate the ammount of red,green and blue light in an RGB led.

Uploaded the code for the second homework in the file"Knock_detecor.ino".The code allows (or should allow) a passive buzzer to 'detect' a knock on the surface where it sits and print "Knock" on the serial monitor to show it.In addition,5 seconds after the knock was detected an active buzzer will start ringing.It can be stopped by pressing the button.
Note:The program uses the last knock as the starting point for the 5 seconds counter.If you keep knocking the buzzer won't start ringing.As with knocking on actual doors,please be patient!
Note:If the button is pressed before the 5 seconds have passed the buzzer won't start ringing.
