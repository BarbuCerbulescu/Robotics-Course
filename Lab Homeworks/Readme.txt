Uploaded the code for first homework in the file "RGB_led.ino"(initially uploaded in the main folder rather than the homework one).The code allows you to use the values recieved from three potentiometers in order to regulate the ammount of red,green and blue light in an RGB led.

Uploaded the code for the second homework in the file"Knock_detecor.ino".The code allows (or should allow) a passive buzzer to 'detect' a knock on the surface where it sits and print "Knock" on the serial monitor to show it.In addition,5 seconds after the knock was detected an active buzzer will start ringing.It can be stopped by pressing the button.
Note:If the button is pressed before the 5 seconds have passed the buzzer won't start ringing.

Uploaded the code for the third homework in the file"4dig7segJoystickControl.ino".The code allows you to control the digits on a 4 digit 7 segments display using the joystick.By moving the joystick horizontally you can choose which of the 4 displays to modify.In order to change the value on a display you must first "lock" the display by pressing the switch.After you lock it,move the joystick vertically to change the digit shown it. You can move to another display once you've locked one.To be able to do that again you need to "unlock" the display by pressing the switch again.You will know if the display is locked or not by seeing if the digit on it flickers.If it flickers it's unlocked.
Note:I couldn't get the decimal point to light up for the display currently chosen.You will be able to distinguish it from the others by the fact that if the current displays is unlocked the digit on it flickers and if it is locked then the value on it will modify by moving the switch vertically.

Uploade the code for the fourth homework in the file "lcd_game_menu.ino".The program simulates a video game menu that can be navigated through using the joystick and displays on an lcd screen.
