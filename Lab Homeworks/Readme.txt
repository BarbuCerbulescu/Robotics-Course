Uploaded the code for first homework in the file "RGB_led.ino"(initially uploaded in the main folder rather than the homework one).The code allows you to use the values recieved from three potentiometers in order to regulate the ammount of red,green and blue light in an RGB led.

Uploaded the code for the second homework in the file"Knock_detecor.ino".The code allows (or should allow) a passive buzzer to 'detect' a knock on the surface where it sits and print "Knock" on the serial monitor to show it.In addition,5 seconds after the knock was detected an active buzzer will start ringing.It can be stopped by pressing the button.
Note:If the button is pressed before the 5 seconds have passed the buzzer won't start ringing.

Uploaded the code for the third homework in the file"4dig7segJoystickControl.ino".The code allows you to control the digits on a 4 digit 7 segments display using the joystick.By moving the joystick vertically you can change the value on one of the 4 displays.By moving the joystick horizontally you can select which of the 4 displays to modify.By pressing the switch you can "lock" the value so that it is shown  even when the display is not selected.In order to modify a locked value you will have to press the switch again to unlock it.When the value on a display is not locked it will flicker.
Note:For a reason I can't understand if you don't have any locked value the value on the current display while unlocked will not flicker.
