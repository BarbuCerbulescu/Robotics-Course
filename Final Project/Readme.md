## Vending Machine Simulator

This device and the associated code attempts to simulate the workings of a vending machine (although in a somewhat reversed order):
you select and object that you wish to buy,pay the appropriate sum after which will you able to take the object from a special compartiment.

Some features of an actual vending machine,mainly the ability to 'absorb' money inside of it,were removed for the sake of simplicity.The machine will detect the value of a special banknote given to it and make calculations based on the detected value but will not do anything to the banknote itself.

**How to use :**
Select the item you wish to 'purchase' by pressing the button next to its name.

After you've selected an item,the ammount of money you have to pay will be displayed on the LCD screen .

Each banknote you scan decreases the value displayed by the appropriate ammount.Once it reaches 0,a 'Thank you!" message will be displayed on the LCD screen to signify that the purchase is complete.

After that,the item will be dropped into the special compartiment from where you can take it.
