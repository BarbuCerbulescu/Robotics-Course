For the matrix project I have chosen to implement a game called DodgeQuest.
The aim of the game is to survive a series of attacks with differing properties coming from outside the screen(all directions) untill the countdown expires,
at which point you will have either passed to the next level or you will have completed the game.There are 3 or 4 levels to complete.
As sugested by the title,your only option is to dodge them which you will do by moving vertically,horizontally or diagonally.
The game will be displayed on a 8x8 LED matrix controlled using a MAX7219 driver and movement will be acomplished using the joystick.
The game will also be accompanied by a menu displayed on an lcd screen that you can navigate through using the joystick.
The menu will allow you to see other people's highscore,along with their names,as well as allow you to add your own name to the highscore
table and change the difficulty level.
